README  Project name: The Ultimate Vendor Author: Wyatt Webster 

Project Description: Since their creation, vending machines have yet to improve. Snacks frequently get stuck, the machines are broken into, the items rarely change, and they are all limited in the amount of items they can contain. I believe this problem can be solved by making vending machines GUI’s, rather than a clear window looking into machine contents. By making this change, all of the previously listed problems with vending machines can be solved. Since a GUI will be used, we can use new inner technology to fetch snacks, opposed to dropping them off a conveyor belt that usually gets stuck. Also, this will prevent thieves from easily being able to smash through the front of the machine. Furthermore, this will allow the machine to have more items because the GUI could have pages of items, rather than being forced to show everything through the glass. Lastly, we can allow the user to enter in new requests for items, and the requests with the highest frequencies will be later added to the menu. I believe that a new era of vending machine technology is needed, and this era begins with The Ultimate Vender.

Future Additions:
In the future I think it would be cool to add functionality for allowing the users to sort the snack items in many different ways. For example, snacks could be sorted by category. This is part of the reason why my Snack Objects already contain a category field. Currently, my Snack Objects sort alphabetically.
